# Jquery based automated instagram unfollower

This is basic Jquery script that simulates user action.
User action be like looking into following list, then searching user in followers list. If chapri user has unfollowed you after following back, then you can unfollow user by clicking on unfollow button.
This user action should take few inspect elements, copy selectors and click functions.
Using these jquery functions, writing this script was EZ.

I dont know how to simulate scroll on a div element, if anyone can do that let me know.
So, prerequisite will be that you scroll over list and get ready the list.

This script is for someone who repeats now and then `tere me kis baat ka attitude hai bhai`, but also lazy to do five minute job, but interested to invest 3 to 4 hours automating same shit.

## Usage
- Open instagram and Login, head over to your profile.
- then use inspect element option to open developer panel.
- Open console.
- Click on followers, load entire list. 
- Click on following, load entire list by scrolling yourself.
- Copy and Paste unfollower_script.js code in console.
- Type `unfollow()` in console and press Enter.
- Console will show some information, Run and find out.
- In prompt type y or n, as you like.
- No mercy, every account that doesnt follow above rule will be unfollowed. Even Meme accounts.

## Results
- You no longer follow chapri accounts.
- You save some time.
- You post console logs into insta story and feel like hacker.
